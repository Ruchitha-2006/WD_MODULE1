   Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, aiming to score more runs than the opposition. It involves batting, bowling, and fielding, and is played on a pitch with wickets. Cricket originated in England and is now popular in many countries, including India, Australia, and the West Indies.

  Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport where the batting side tries to score as many runs as possible while the bowling side attempts to get batters out, also known as taking wickets, and restrict the flow or runs. Cricket bats are constructed from high-grade willow with balls made of leather stitched onto a cork core.
